A first attempt at a program to check the efficiency of repetive GET (so far) requests in context of multithreading.

It should be run with arguments:
myApiUrl numbersOfThreadsSeparatedByComma NumberOfAttempts

Like:
https://myapi.com/ 1,5,10 60

In response it will log each attempt.

Like:
INFO: Attempt with 1 threads finished in 11.788000 seconds
It returned 60 valid and 0 invalid results
INFO: Attempt with 5 threads finished in 2.396000 seconds
It returned 60 valid and 0 invalid results
INFO: Attempt with 10 threads finished in 1.088000 seconds
It returned 60 valid and 0 invalid results


It will be moved to JMH in the future como dios manda.
